Rosalind (http://rosalind.info) is a useful website where you can find explanations about bioinformatics topics.
Some people, like me, loves have a look of some informations directly from Linux shell, such as Telegram chats and so on.

Using this script you can read the theory that Rosalind provides about biology (here the summary http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/).

I know, this is a very stupid program, but someone could think it is good, and I'm would be happy to hear it!
